aboutText				= Subitarius is a database viewer for use in competitive \
							extemporaneous speaking. Articles from major news \
							sites are retrieved and stored for use offline. This \
							way, the articles are still available without \
							internet access and thus within the competition rules.

usageHeading			= Usage
usageText				= There currently two main means of navigating the \
							database: the jump view and the hierarchy view. The \
							jump view allows you to navigate directly to a list \
							of articles on a given topic; you must enter the \
							topic name into the text box in the view. The \
							hierarchy view presents all indexed topics in a \
							hierarchical manner, providing a link to the list \
							of relevant articles for each topic. The full text \
							of each article is available from the article list.
