						<string>Al Jazeera's Lucia Newman covered the mining crisis and the dramatic rescue and takes us back to meet some of the same characters she met at the time to see how the tragedy and the subsequent adulation that followed the rescue have impacted the lives of many of the miners and their families. She also asks if the Chilean government has kept its promise to improve mining safety standards in the country. In an exclusive interview, Chile's minister of mining acknowledges that much more needs to be done to improve safety conditions in the country's copper mines.</string>
