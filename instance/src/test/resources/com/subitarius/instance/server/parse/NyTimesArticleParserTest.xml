				<string>Google and Verizon Near Deal on Pay Tiers for Web</string>

						<string>WASHINGTON — Google and Verizon, two leading players in Internet service and content, are nearing an agreement that could allow Verizon to speed some online content to Internet users more quickly if the content’s creators are willing to pay for the privilege.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The charges could be paid by companies, like YouTube, owned by Google, for example, to Verizon, one of the nation’s leading Internet service providers, to ensure that its content received priority as it made its way to consumers. The agreement could eventually lead to higher charges for Internet users.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Such an agreement could overthrow a once-sacred tenet of Internet policy known as net neutrality, in which no form of content is favored over another. In its place, consumers could soon see a new, tiered system, which, like cable television, imposes higher costs for premium levels of service.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Any agreement between Verizon and Google could also upend the efforts of the Federal Communications Commission to assert its authority over broadband service, which was severely restricted by a federal appeals court decision in April.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>People close to the negotiations who were not authorized to speak publicly about them said an agreement could be reached as soon as next week. If completed, Google, whose Android operating system powers many Verizon wireless phones, would agree not to challenge Verizon’s ability to manage its broadband Internet network as it pleased.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Since the court decision, involving Comcast, in April, the F.C.C. has been trying to find a way to regulate broadband delivery, and that effort has been the subject of a series of private meetings at the agency’s headquarters in recent weeks. At the meetings, officials from the nation’s biggest Internet service and content providers, including Google and Verizon, have tried to reach a consensus on how broadband Internet service should be regulated in light of the decision. Those meetings continued this week, apart from the talks between Google and Verizon.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The court decision said the F.C.C. lacked the authority to require that an Internet service provider refrain from blocking or slowing down some content or applications, or giving favor to others. The F.C.C. has since sought another way in which to enforce the concept of net neutrality. But its proposals have been greeted with much objection in Congress and among Internet service providers, cable companies and some Internet content producers.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>A spokesman for Verizon said that the company was still engaged in the larger talks to reach a consensus at the F.C.C. and declined to comment on other negotiations. A spokeswoman for Google also declined to comment. While a deal between Google and Verizon would affect only those two companies, it could sway the opinions of lawmakers, many of whom have questioned the wisdom of the F.C.C.’s plans to oversee broadband service.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>At issue for consumers is how the companies that provide the pipeline to the Internet will ultimately direct traffic on their system, and how quickly consumers are able to gain access to certain Web content. Consumers could also see continually rising bills for Internet service, much as they have for cable television.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The prospect of a Google-Verizon agreement infuriates many consumer advocates, who feel that it would concentrate in a few corporations control of what to date has been a free and open Internet system in which consumers decide which companies are successful.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>“The point of a network neutrality rule is to prevent big companies from dividing the Internet between them,” said Gigi B. Sohn, president and a founder of Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group. “The fate of the Internet is too large a matter to be decided by negotiations involving two companies, even companies as big as Verizon and Google.”</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>It is not clear that the Google-Verizon talks will result in a deal, or that any agreement would extend beyond those companies. David M. Fish, a spokesman for Verizon, acknowledged the talks, saying, “We’ve been working with Google for 10 months to reach an agreement on broadband policy.”</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>But, Mr. Fish added, “We are currently engaged in and committed to the negotiation process led by the F.C.C. We are optimistic this process will reach a consensus that can maintain an open Internet, and the investment and innovation required to sustain it.”</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The F.C.C. process he referred to is what is jokingly called at the agency headquarters “the secret meeting.” At least nine times in the last seven weeks — including Wednesday, with another meeting scheduled for Thursday — a group that includes Google, Verizon, AT&amp;T, Skype, cable system operators and a group called the Open Internet Coalition has met with top F.C.C. officials to discuss net neutrality and the agency’s legal basis for regulating Internet service.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Cable and telephone companies want free rein to sell specialized services like “paid prioritization,” which would speed some content to users more quickly for a fee. Wireless companies, meanwhile, want no restrictions on wireless broadband, which they see as a different technology than Internet service over wires.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Many content providers — like Amazon, eBay and Skype — prefer no favoritism on the Internet or they want to be sure that if a pay system exists, all content providers have the opportunity to pay for faster service.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The F.C.C., meanwhile, favors a level playing field, but it cannot impose one as long as its authority over broadband is in legal doubt. It has proposed a solution that would reclassify broadband Internet service under the Communications Act from its current designation as an “information service,” a lightly regulated designation, to a “telecommunications service,” a category that, like telephone service, is subject to stricter regulation.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The F.C.C. has said that it does not want to impose strict regulation on Internet service and rates, but seeks only the authority to enforce broadband privacy and guarantee equal access. It also wants to use federal money to subsidize broadband service for rural areas.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>While the F.C.C. is gathering public comment on its reclassification proposal, it has convened the private talks, which are overseen by Edward Lazarus, the chief of staff to Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C.’s chairman.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The talks have produced some common ground among the participants on smaller matters. But one participant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the group members agreed not to discuss their deliberations publicly, said there had been little movement “on the few big issues that are the most important.”</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Frustrated with that lack of progress in the last two months, direct talks between Google and Verizon have accelerated, according to people close to the discussions who were not authorized to comment publicly.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Google and Verizon have their own interests at stake in negotiating separately. The Android operating system from Google is used on many Verizon phones, including the Droid, a competitor to the iPhone from Apple.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Consumer groups have objected to the private meetings, saying that too many stakeholders are being left out of discussions over the future of the Internet.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Mr. Lazarus said the meetings “are part of our efforts to identify the best way forward in the wake of the Comcast case to preserve the openness and vibrancy of the Internet.”</string>

						<string>IN 1980, Steve Jobs went to a brown-bag lunch at Stanford business school, looking for summer help. Other Apple executives were busy explaining what a personal computer was when he sauntered in; they stopped mid-sentence as, dressed in a vest, jeans and Birkenstock sandals, he settled himself, cross-legged, on top of a desk. He looked as if he were about to hold a yoga class. Then he began to talk, instead, about revolutionizing the world.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Some four or five students heeded his call, including my husband-to-be, David O’Connor. This was less than half the number who signed up to work for Hewlett-Packard, but never mind. That summer job became a full-time job when David graduated, and a kind of dream. Apple, back then, had a hot-air balloon. It had a race car. When the second “Star Wars” movie opened, Apple bought out a theater so the whole company could go. A friend’s father called a job at Apple the worst possible thing that could happen to a young person, as everything that followed was bound to be a disappointment. And perhaps that was true.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>But, of course, it was exciting in a way even an onlooking writer could understand — strangely familiar, too, as if it were being run by a cousin. Apple was, for example, antiestablishment, as all writers are. It was anti-DEC and anti-I.B.M, a harborer of an anti-acronym acrimony that writers, naturally, shared. What’s more, Steve Jobs’s perfectionism made perfect sense to people like me: Of course, he sweated every detail; of course he drove others mad. He was a J. D. Salinger who, weirdly, knew computing.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Was this why the Apple computer felt like a thing worth trying to write on? Though I would never have thought to use a word processor — those were for offices — I was open to the Apple II, and first worked on one at David’s apartment in the fall of 1980. The screen was black and the type green, and there were only 40 characters per line. But you could insert things; you did not have to retype an entire page if you had a new line of dialogue. And, equally exciting: you could delete things.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>More important, you worked with that little blinking cursor before you. No one in the world particularly cared if you wrote and, of course, you knew the computer didn’t care, either. But it was waiting for you to type something. It was not inert and passive, like the page. It was listening. It was your ally. It was your audience. And with it — on it — whatever — you could try things. You were not wasting paper; you were not making a racket. You were not even writing, exactly, as no one you knew wrote this way. Everything you’d read as an English major was far, far away; words like “the literary tradition” belonged to another galaxy. It was just you and this little blinking light, which somehow made you feel like it was always the middle of the night. But for the on-off switch, you would never have called the computer a machine.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Later, at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, I used a typewriter. But whenever I visited David in California, I wrote on his computer. I did not hide the fact that I did this, but I did not advertise it, either: “real writers,” many believed, used paper and pencil. O.K., so fiction writers, hacks that we were, used typewriters. But computers were suspect. Some writers I knew used the university mainframe to prepare manuscripts, but they typically doctored their pages before sending them out to magazines. They whited things out here and there, and made corrections by pen. They turned a page upside down, or rumpled the pages a little. In short, they tried to make their stories look as though they’d been, not printed, but typed.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>And so did I, sometimes, though I knew that the prejudices were all wrong. Maybe there was something dronelike about working on a mainframe; maybe sitting at stations and terminals really was at odds with the play at the heart of creative work. The Apple II, though, was born both in play and to encourage play; and this was even more true of the Lisa and Macintosh computers that followed. My first Lisa was a prototype, whose graphic interface I still glow to recall, and not just because David had worked on it. Truly, it was the sheer friendliness of the interface that I loved. And the mouse! No longer did you need to think about what you were doing; you just did it.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>What came out of this computer was not further from the human heart; it was closer. It was looser, freer, more spontaneous — more democratic, too. Writers in the past had often depended on an amanuensis to get their work out; behind the Mr. Tolstoys there was often a Mrs. Tolstoy. But now Mrs. Tolstoy could also write, if she liked. She could get her thoughts down and send them out with an ease she could never have dreamed of before.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>As for whether the Apple computers changed not only who wrote, but what they wrote, I can’t speak for others. I can only say that these computers coaxed out of me an expansiveness the typewriter never did. For every writer, the leap from short story to novel is, well, a leap. It involves faith, and resources, and a conception, finally, of how much room is yours in the world. I was not a person who would have looked at a ream of paper and thought, “Sure, that is mine to fill up.” But I turned out to be a person who could keep moving a cursor until I’d filled one ream, then another. It is a truly minuscule reason, in the scheme of things, for which to celebrate and mourn Steve Jobs. Still, I add my small reason to the infinity of others.</string>

					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Undermining Qaddafi’s control of Libya has not been easy. And as expected, it has taken thousands of lives and will most probably take many more until he is finally dislodged.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Today for the first time in 42 years, the majority of Libyans are free from dictatorship. And although the road to the future may look smooth, it will not be. Obstacles are looming high that could undermine the infant revolt. There are too many guns in the street, no political institutions, no security forces to keep the peace, and more important a built-up anger at supports of a regime that has dominated and abused Libyan lives for such a long time.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>How will the fragile governmental structure deal with all the weapons, any potential lawlessness, and hostile elements that are bound to remain even after the Libyan dictator is dislodged? These are all important questions that need to be answered and dealt with.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The first step in dealing with these issues is to continue doing what is being done in the areas liberated thus far, and that is to enter the liberated cities with their own people. There are still people in Tripoli who command respect and many are happy to see Qaddafi gone. They need to be brought on board to participate in the national reconciliation.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Libya’s revolution has perhaps proven to be the exception in that we saw little to no looting or destruction of public wealth, nor did we witness other atrocities that usually accompany such changes. It seems that Libyans realize that engaging in such behavior would undermine the very goals they have fought and died for. This is good news and leads me to believe that among them there is not only the understanding and willingness to give the National Transitional Council a chance to forge ahead with the necessary changes. First among them is electing a legitimate body to finalize a new Libyan constitution and oversee new popular elections to approve the constitution framework and follow it up with popular elections that staff the new institutions and bring them on line.</string>

						<string>It stands to reason that students with high attendance rates have a better chance of succeeding at school.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>With data from the city’s Independent Budget Office, the value of attendance can be measured more precisely. The passing rate in math for students that missed five or fewer days of school in 2009-10 was 69 percent. Students that missed six to 10 days? 55 percent. Chronically absent (21 or more days)? 28 percent.</string>

					<void method="add">
						<string>This is part of a comprehensive package of system-wide and school-level data released today by the Independent Budget Office. As part of the 2009 state law renewing mayoral control of the system, the budget office was charged with enhancing the the “official and public understanding” of schools. They hired Raymond Domanico, a former Department of Education data analyst, to handle the job.</string>

						<string>Compared with a decade ago, Education Department per-pupil spending on debt service has doubled ($1,698 now, up from $847) and spending on pension contributions has risen nearly fivefold ($2,916, up from $620).</string>
