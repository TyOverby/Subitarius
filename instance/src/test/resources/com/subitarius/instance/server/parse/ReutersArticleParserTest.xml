						<string>WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A state of emergency after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake is keeping much of New Zealand's second-biggest city shut on Monday but financial markets have mostly shrugged off the quake as the long-term economic impact is seen limited. Many businesses in the South Island city of Christchurch remain closed as a state of emergency was extended until Wednesday after the country's most damaging earthquake in 80 years tore up roads, smashed water and sewer pipes, and severely damaged many buildings.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>New Zealand's dollar eased slightly while government debt fell on fears of increased bond issuance but stocks were higher as the estimated NZ$2 billion ($1.4 billion) damage bill was seen relatively light and could not derail a rally fueled from overseas markets.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Economists predicted the quake could eat into New Zealand's economic growth this year and keep interest rates on hold until there is more clarity on the impact.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>"Overall there will be a negative impact on economic activity, with Christchurch accounting for about 15 percent of GDP," ANZ-National Bank senior economist Khoon Goh said, adding the exact impact cannot yet be quantified.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>"It also means the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will most likely be on hold in September," Goh said.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>But some predicted the quake -- which claimed no lives and resulted in only two serious injuries -- could add to growth in 2011 as rebuilding efforts ramp up.</string>

						<string>"We've got to move to the rebuilding and refocusing stages, how we get Christchurch up and running again," Prime Minister John Key told Television New Zealand.</string>
