						<string>WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A state of emergency after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake is keeping much of New Zealand's second-biggest city shut on Monday but financial markets have mostly shrugged off the quake as the long-term economic impact is seen limited. Many businesses in the South Island city of Christchurch remain closed as a state of emergency was extended until Wednesday after the country's most damaging earthquake in 80 years tore up roads, smashed water and sewer pipes, and severely damaged many buildings.</string>

					<void method="add">
						<string>New Zealand's dollar eased slightly while government debt fell on fears of increased bond issuance but stocks were higher as the estimated NZ$2 billion ($1.4 billion) damage bill was seen relatively light and could not derail a rally fueled from overseas markets.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Economists predicted the quake could eat into New Zealand's economic growth this year and keep interest rates on hold until there is more clarity on the impact.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>"Overall there will be a negative impact on economic activity, with Christchurch accounting for about 15 percent of GDP," ANZ-National Bank senior economist Khoon Goh said, adding the exact impact cannot yet be quantified.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>"It also means the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will most likely be on hold in September," Goh said.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>But some predicted the quake -- which claimed no lives and resulted in only two serious injuries -- could add to growth in 2011 as rebuilding efforts ramp up.</string>

						<string>"We've got to move to the rebuilding and refocusing stages, how we get Christchurch up and running again," Prime Minister John Key told Television New Zealand.</string>

						<string>HARARE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto has told Zimbabwe's government it will give up a 51 percent stake in its local diamond unit Murowa, state media reported on Saturday, making it the first foreign-owned firm to voluntarily comply with the country's local ownership law.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>"Murowa Diamonds wrote to us (on Thursday) saying they have given up 51 percent of shares and these would be given to our people," Kasukuwere told the official Herald newspaper.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Murowa officials were not available for comment.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The heavily criticised law is aimed mainly at mining firms and banks operating in the resource-rich country, which has become an economic basket case because of what analysts say are years of mismanagement by President Robert Mugabe's government.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Last month, Indigenisation and Empowerment Minister Saviour Kasukuwere said mining firms had mostly met a September deadline by which they were required to submit plans to transfer a 51 percent stake in their operations to locals.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The world's number one and two platinum producers, Anglo American Platinum and Impala Platinum are also major foreign mining firms with assets in Zimbabwe.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Critics have said a major reason for the law is to allow Mugabe's ZANU-PF party to build up a war chest ahead of national elections that could come as early as next year.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>They say Zimbabwe, emerging from a decade-long slump, can not raise the funds needed to take over the mining assets and the cash generated by the firms would go to top officials, not ordinary people, who rank among the poorest in the world.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Regulations supporting the empowerment law require miners to choose local partners from a government approved list, which Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party says is meant to benefit Mugabe's allies.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Mugabe was forced to share power with Tsvangirai two years ago after disputed elections in 2008. The two have sharp differences over the ownership policy.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>"My overall assessment is that over 90 percent of the submitted proposals do not meet the minimum requirements (of choosing partners from a government list) and there seems to be an element of resistance," Kasukuwere was quoted as saying.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Kasukuwere also said plans submitted by foreign mines generally show the companies want to sell a maximum of 30 percent of shares while the remaining 21 percent would be made up of empowerment credits awarded for social investments made in infrastructure, health and education facilities.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Implats unit Zimplats, which is the largest platinum producer in Zimbabwe was given up to next month to fully comply with the empowerment law.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Zimbabwe has the world's second-largest known platinum reserves after neighbouring South Africa and market watchers and investors are therefore keen to see how the situation unfolds against the backdrop of red-hot commodity prices.</string>
