						<string>Polling stations opened late due to lack of supplies. Voters' names didn’t appear on registration rolls. In other cases, citizens were even unsure of where to vote.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>But for Haiti, Sunday's election was deemed a success overall, as Haitians cast ballots in what could be their nation's most important presidential elections.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>On top of handling billions of dollars in foreign aid, the new president will be tasked with leading the country through the reconstruction from last year’s earthquake that has left the capital covered in debris: Some 800,000 people live in tent camps in the capital, still displaced from the January 2010 earthquake that damaged or destroyed 188,383 homes and killed some 230,000 people. A cholera epidemic that began last fall continues to spread.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Preliminary results are not expected until March 31 from the second-round election that pitted former First Lady Mirlande Manigat against flashy musician Michel “Sweet Micky” Martelly. Final results are scheduled to be confirmed April 16.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>To a lesser degree, Sunday's run-off vote was marked by many of the same problems as those voters experienced in a first round that culminated with 12 of 19 candidates asking for the vote to be annulled due to widespread fraud, although this time violence was avoided.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>“They want to choose for us, they don’t want us to vote, it’s a game,” says Jaybe Alias, who lives in Camp Corail, one of the only government-organized displacement camps. Thousands of people showed up to vote in the camp’s polling station, just north of Port-au-Prince, but election officials had just 40 names on voter rolls. None were his.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>“There are thousand of people here,” Mr. Alias says. “How come only 40 people can vote?”</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Stories similar to Alias’s were common.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Nevertheless, Haiti’s Provisional Electoral Council deemed the vote successful. Council President Gaillot Dorsinvil told reporters that irregularities would have “no impact on the electoral process as a whole.” Edmond Mulet, who leads the United Nations’ stabilizing force in the country, echoed Mr. Dorsinvil, saying that he saw “a lot of differences compared to Nov. 28. Participation is great.”</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>This election has been long delayed. Under the original electoral schedule, a new president was to be inaugurated in February. Yet, due to problems in the first round, the run-off vote was pushed back.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>It was complicated by the arrivals of former dictator Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier in January and former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide just days before the election. Both had come back from exile.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Their arrivals only seemed to distract from a tense political situation that drew attention from the Obama administration. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton flew to Port-au-Prince in February to convince President René Préval to adopt an international mission’s recommendation and break the electoral logjam. As a result, Haiti’s electoral council dropped Préval-backed candidate Jude Célestin to third in the final first-round tallies, making him ineligible for the run-off vote. Mr. Martelly replaced him.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>On the streets of Port-au-Prince Sunday, a feeling of calm prevailed, a marked difference from the Nov. 28 vote in which thousands took to the streets amid claims of fraud and ballot stuffing.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Hernes Fresner had no trouble voting in Port-au-Prince and later traveled up the hills outside of the city to the suburb of Petionville to support Martelly at his polling station. “We need change. We need a different type of person leading the country,” he says. Martelly “likes the people and the people like him.”</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Supporters of Martelly peppered him with campaign signs thrown like confetti.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Both Martelly and his opponent, Ms. Manigat, are considered politically conservative, but they offered contrasting styles to an electorate preoccupied with the slowness of reconstruction from last year’s 7.0-magnitude earthquake and the cholera epidemic that followed.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Martelly, a middle-aged kompa music star known for his pants-dropping routines on stage, was a street favorite among many young people in a country with a population that is reportedly more than half under age 25.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Manigat, an avuncular figure 20 years the elder of Martelly, was known as an academic and as the wife of a former president.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Regardless of who prevails, Haitians should expect more involvement from foreign governments, particularly in the rebuilding process, says Francois Pierre-Louis, Jr., a professor at Queens College in New York and an adviser to Jacques-Édouard Alexis, a presidential candidate eliminated in the first round.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The run-off election was widely seen as a key step in gaining the confidence of foreign governments that are funding the reconstruction process. Much of the billions in funding pledged to help the country rebuild following last year’s earthquake has been held up because of the electoral crisis. According to the Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti (pdf), governments have yet to disperse 70 percent of $4.53 billion pledged in aid programs for Haiti over 2010 and 2011.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>“We will see the international community playing a much more active role in Haiti after the elections,” Professor Pierre-Louis says. “I think the role that the US will play in this term will be significant.”</string>

						<string>The Venezuelan government continued its attitude of not accepting responsibility for any of the problems of its country, but this time it went from the “Who me?” attitude to simply saying “It’s your fault!” – blaming the electric crisis on excess consumption and not on the inability and incapacity of the administration of President Hugo Chávez to tackle the problems.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The electric problem is not new. Last year, the government blamed El Niño for the crisis, but it quickly became clear that there was more to it, as it became evident that between the lack of maintenance, improvisation, and bad decisions, what was a well-run electrical network when Mr. Chávez took over as president was run into the ground by an ignorant revoution. Despite this, the government declared victory many times over the electrical crisis and blamed problems on sabotage and the weather.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Then, after this weekend’s blackout in Zulia and neighboring states, it was time to shift the blame and put it on “the people.” How irresponsible can you get?</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The reality is different. The Chávez administration put a bunch of incompetent loyal military in the electric companies, slowly removing those that knew how to run the system and decide what to invest in and how to do so. Investment and maintenance were postponed, including that of the Guri dam that provides 70 percent of the electricity in the country.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>But the crisis goes back to Minister Giordani deciding in 1999 to cancel five hydroelectric projects, a perfectly valid decision, but one that was not followed up by creating an alternate plan. This was followed by requesting the help from Cuban “experts” who went to a distributed system, like that of Cuba, from the interconnected one that Venezuela had (has?). They built power plants but forgot the transmission lines. Back to the 1930s you all!</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>And while the government blames consumption, which has definitely gone up, it is its actions that have created the current situation. Zulia’s consumption was not particularly high when the blackout took place last week. The five transformers that exploded did not explode because of demand. They exploded at night, when offices are closed, ACs are off in these buildings and also in many stores. It was not “peak” demand. Not even close to it.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>But what can you expect from a government that builds power plants that produces more electricity than nearby consumption but fails to build the required power lines to take power elsewhere? Or how about buying power plants for Sidor (Venezuela's state-operated steel maker) last year at the heart of Venezuela’s power consumption, but failing to build power lines to take all of Guri’s power elsewhere?</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>So now the show is to make the people believe that it is not the Government’s fault. Blame the “companies” or the “big consumers." Impose a penalty on anyone that does not reduce consumption by 10 percent and give discounts to those that do by more than 20 percent.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Funny, these are capitalistic solutions from a government that froze rates 10 years ago, encouraging consumption, and that wants to give away a few million appliances to the “people” that it imported from China. As far as I know they don’t run on solar energy. Yes, making a consumer out of the last Venezuelan is a very desirable goal. But if you do it, you are going to have to generate all of the power required for them. And you better start charging for it.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>But none of these connections exist in the Chavista mind. It is the giveaway that matters. The paternalistic, let’s give something for free to the masses so they vote for Hugo, the country be damned.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>--- Miguel Octavio, a Venezuelan, is not a fan of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. You can read his blog here.</string>
