						<string>Microsoft has offered up a few more details on what to expect in Windows 8, its highly anticipated operating system that will run on both PCs and tablet computers.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>But one addition, if Microsoft can do it right, could be hugely important for Windows 8 -- its app store.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Steve Sinofsky, who is in charge of Windows 8 development for Microsoft, broke down in a blog post the different teams working on specific aspects of the new OS and an "App Store" team was on the list.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>An app store is, obviously, a store that sells applications, software to run on Windows 8 machines.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The inclusion of an app store in Windows 8 is a natural one, and not much of a surprise given Apple's huge success with selling mobile apps through iTunes and desktop apps through the Mac App Store.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Apple's iTunes has seen more than 15 billion apps downloaded and purchased -- a huge boon for Apple and huge attraction for developers.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>A June screen shot of Windows 8 also featured, prominently, a "shop" icon with a Windows-logo adorned bag sitting beside it, too. And Microsoft has embraced the app store idea with Windows Phone 7's app Marketplace.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Even the much-maligned Windows Vista had an app store called the Windows Marketplace, though it (or Windows Vista) never found much popularity.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Among the questions, however, that remain is just what Microsoft will call its app store.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>If the ongoing lawsuit between Apple and Amazon is any indication, Apple would be terribly unhappy if Microsoft just stuck with that App Store team name for the name of its new store. That's because Apple says the term App Store is a label it owns and that nobody else can use.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Apple sued Amazon in March after the online retail giant revealed its Amazon Appstore for Android, arguing that the similarity in names would confuse consumers looking for Apple's iTunes or Mac App Stores.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Amazon has disputed Apple's claims, arguing itself that "app store" and "appstore" are generic terms that shouldn't be owned by any one person or company.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>What do you think? What will it take for Microsoft's Windows 8 app store to take off? If Microsoft doesn't call their store for apps an app store, what should they call it?</string>

				<string>Canada's election proves surprisingly interesting</string>

						<string>The words "dramatic" and "Canadian election" seldom go together.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Even Canadians are mostly bored by their politics, other than spikes of interest when Quebeckers vote on whether to separate from the rest of Canada (the last time: 16 years ago. Answer: a close "no") or the occasional election fought over more than just the spoils of power (probably not since 1988, when they voted, essentially, on whether to sign a free-trade agreement with the United States. Answer: a grudging "yes").</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>But the just-concluded campaign that on Monday gave Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative Party its long-sought majority government qualifies as suspenseful, at least. Going into election day, the rising fortunes of the socialist New Democrats had not only put that Conservative victory in doubt, but raised the eye-rubbing specter of the left-wing wing party actually winning enough seats to take power in a coalition government.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The New Democrat surge came almost out of nowhere, the union-based party emerging as a force only in mid-campaign. Voters, especially in Quebec, suddenly embraced its leader, Jack Layton, who had never generated much enthusiasm in three previous elections. This time, he was seen as the sunniest leader in a campaign defined by attack ads and accusations of ethical lapses.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Layton and the NDP fell short in the end, but you wouldn't have known from their huge smiles on election night. The perennially third-place party pulled in a record 30% of the votes, winning enough seats to return to Parliament as the official opposition for the first time.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Canadians now find themselves, after almost a decade of tepid minority governments, with a two-party system, a right-left divide between a conservative government and a socialist opposition. Harper can at last govern without looking over his shoulder or cutting deals with other parties, secure he has the votes in Parliament to govern as he pleases.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Since he became prime minister in 2006, his opponents had warned against just that, contending that Harper harbors a secret, extreme right-wing agenda held in check only by his minority status. Give him an unrestrained majority, they warned, and the dark side of Harper — a politician known as a tactical wizard but with an aversion to charm — will be unleashed.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Harper tried to show a bit of uncharacteristic warmth after his win, joking that his staff had cajoled him into swilling champagne from a bottle though he hardly drinks. But he vowed there would be no veering from his carefully chosen political middle ground: hard on crime, low on taxes and a defender of Canada's public healthcare system.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The wind Americans felt blowing down from Canada on Monday was the collective exhale of the Canadian business class. Canadian pride used to derive from a self-satisfied sense that they were the "gentle" North Americans, in contrast to those who embraced a rawer capitalism to the south. Canada had free, universal healthcare. Less gun crime. It took a pass on George W. Bush's war in Iraq.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>But since 2008, Canadian bragging rights have been based on how their economy survived the worst ravages of the global recession. Sure, there was need for a bit of a spending stimulus (everybody was doing it). But the tightly regulated Canadian banks emerged largely unscathed, held up by many as a model of financial sanity. There was no wide-scale housing bust. And an economy once criticized for being overly reliant on commodities started to look pretty good in an era of scarcity and high demand from China.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>All that seemed threatened by the prospect of a New Democrat-led coalition. Layton started the campaign with little thought of winning, scattering promises to spend more public money with little worry of being called to account. Then came his inexplicable rise in the polls.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Why, a perplexed business community asked, with the economy doing so well, would we shoot ourselves in the foot by voting for a party rooted in organized labor?</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The Conservative majority has now squelched that boardroom panic. Harper has four years to govern, while Layton will have to wrestle a party of rookies into a viable opposition. More than half of the New Democrats' 102 members of Parliament come from Quebec, the second-largest province, where many of its candidates were mere place-holders for a party that never expected to seriously compete. Layton's new team includes such unlikely members as Ruth Ellen Brosseau, 21, an assistant manager at a university pub who speaks little French and took time off during the campaign to vacation in Las Vegas.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The New Democrats benefited from Quebec's habit of swinging massively behind a single party. For the last seven elections, that party had been the Bloc Quebecois, which was dedicated to making the case for Quebec independence from a platform in the federal government.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>But the Bloc was the big loser in Monday's vote, discovering that even Quebeckers who want their own country were fed up with a party that could talk of nothing else. The Bloc was reduced to a rump of four seats, not enough to qualify for official party status.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The other losers were the Liberals, who once saw themselves as Canada's Natural Governing Party but who have failed to find their voice in recent years. Leader Michael Ignatieff, a former journalist and Harvard University academic, resigned Tuesday after seeing the party's support collapse to a historic low.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Some strategists on the left argue that only a merger of the Liberals and New Democrats can ever expect to supplant the Conservatives, a move that may gain momentum after the Liberals' crushing defeat. But even as he left politics, Ignatieff warned that such an alignment would ill-serve a country where most voters still see themselves in the middle.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>"I think the surest guarantee of a future for the Liberal Party of Canada is four years of Conservative right-wing government and four years of NDP left-wing opposition," he said. "I think after that experience Canadians will, I hope, again discover why you have a Liberal Party in the center."</string>

					<void method="add">
						<string>Reporting from Clarksdale, Miss.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Gail Giaramita was walking door-to-door in this old cotton town on a recent afternoon, genially informing voters about the simple choice they faced when it came to Initiative 26, the statewide ballot measure that would define personhood as beginning at the moment of fertilization.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>"If you believe that the unborn are human beings, you need to vote yes," Giaramita explained to W.L. Wilkins, proprietor of Big Mama's grocery store. "If you believe that women should continue to have the right to abort their babies, you need to vote no."</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>If that's all there was to it — if Initiative 26 would simply ban all abortions, even in cases of rape or incest — this proposed amendment to the state Constitution would be controversial enough. But opponents of the measure are warning of other potential consequences, including a ban on many birth control pills and a severe hampering of popular infertility treatments.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Proponents call these charges untrue "scare tactics."</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Either way, the measure's passage would count as an unprecedented attempt to nullify the abortion right granted under Roe vs. Wade. Personhood USA, the main supporter of the Mississippi measure, says a victory here could "change [the] abortion debate," as part of a "larger, global movement to define when life begins in an effort to undercut the case for legalized abortion."</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>At the same time, however, many observers, including some key antiabortion activists, expect the initiative to be immediately challenged in federal court, and probably struck down, with new rulings that may end up strengthening the hand of abortion supporters.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Among the doubters is Joseph Latino, the Roman Catholic bishop of Jackson, Miss., who has called the personhood effort "noble," but declined to endorse it, warning that it "could ultimately harm our efforts to overthrow Roe vs. Wade."</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The idea of ending abortion by retooling the state-level legal definition of a person is not new, but it may have its best chance of success in Tuesday's vote in Mississippi — the most conservative state in the nation, according to a Gallup poll released in February. Both Democratic and Republican candidates for governor and attorney general here support the initiative, and as of last month, the "yes" faction has a substantial fundraising lead on the "no" crowd.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>"I think our chances are very good," said Les Riley, the initiative's sponsor and founder of the group Personhood Mississippi. "But I don't believe in chance. I believe in providence."</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>In recent years, a number of states have considered and rejected similar proposals, most notably Colorado, where propositions were voted down in 2008 and 2010. Those efforts and the one in Mississippi were backed by Personhood USA, a Colorado-based group that has attracted antiabortion activists fed up with waiting for the U.S. Supreme Court to tilt in their favor.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The group is hoping to put similar initiatives before voters in a number of states next year, including in California, where supporters plan to begin gathering signatures in January, President Keith Mason said.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>In Mississippi, the initiative's opponents are characterizing it as a case of government overreach, in apparent deference to the state's conservative tenor.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>One TV ad from the "vote no" group Mississippians for Healthy Families features a rape victim who says the initiative goes "too far."</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>"It's perfectly acceptable to be pro-life and against Initiative 26," she says.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Though few top state politicians of either party have criticized the initiative, medical groups have. The Mississippi State Medical Assn. has warned that if the initiative passes, doctors could be charged with murder or wrongful death for "employing techniques physicians have used for years."</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The Mississippi Nurses Assn. has said that some birth controls pills could become illegal, because the hormones they contain not only prevent ovulation, they might prevent a fertilized egg from implanting into the uterus.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>A group called Parents Against MS 26 argues that in vitro fertilization would be essentially rendered ineffective because the initiative could ban the freezing of leftover embryos created as part of the IVF process. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine has stated that the initiative would "thwart the ability of those who suffer from infertility to seek treatment appropriate to their disease."</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The group Yes on 26 has called these and other concerns "scare tactics" promulgated by national groups such as Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union . The initiative, proponents say, would not ban in vitro fertilization per se, only the destruction of unused embryos. Doctors, they say, would not be prevented from saving the life of a woman during a problematic pregnancy . And they promise that "most forms" of birth control pills would not be banned.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>If passed, the interpretation of the law would not be up to the initiative's authors, but to the courts, and possibly the state Legislature, said I. Glenn Cohen, a Harvard Law professor who has been following the issue.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>On the streets of Clarksdale, Giaramita, a 56-year-old volunteer for the Yes on 26 campaign, made her case with the sweet, Bible-based style she honed in 2010; she had bid for a congressional seat as a member of the conservative Constitution Party but lost.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>She tried to keep her message focused on abortion, and found a largely receptive audience as she passed out handbills with a photo of a fetus and the message, "Give me a chance. I am a person."</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>She had the vote of Oliver Hicks Jr., a retired carpenter who gave her a hearty "Amen" as she made her pitch.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Hicks said God did not want us to kill "unborn kids." As for the other issues? "That's just something they're saying," he said.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>James Bopp Jr., an attorney and well-known antiabortion activist, has outlined what he believes to be the most likely legal fate of a personhood amendment like Mississippi's: A federal circuit court would strike it down. An appellate court would uphold the decision. And the Supreme Court would decline to review it.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The only ones who would gain in that scenario, he argues, would be the opponents' lawyers, who would collect statutory attorney's fees from the state.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>"The effort will have enriched the pro-abortion forces for no gain for the pro-life side," he wrote in an influential 2007 memo on personhood amendments, which he said still reflected his position on the issue. "In fact, there will be a loss because there will be yet another federal court decision declaring that state law on abortion is superseded by the federal Constitution."</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>The Liberty Counsel, a conservative public-interest law firm, has argued that it is "by no means certain" that a lower court would find a personhood amendment unconstitutional. The group sees "no alternative to a personhood approach that offers any chance of ending abortion in the foreseeable future."</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Brad Prewitt, executive director of the Yes on 26 campaign, said supporters can't worry about how things will shake out in the federal courts. Rather, he said, they need to focus on what's right.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Giaramita, traipsing between lawns in Clarksdale, agreed.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>"This is not an intellectual decision," she said. "This is not a political decision. It's a moral decision."</string>

					<void method="add">
						<string>In the end, the mystery in the Amazon rain forest depends on the assumption (spoiler alert ahead!) that a pharmaceutical company would see all sorts of millions to be made with a drug that would allow 70-year-old women to become pregnant, but that no drug company would be interested if that same substance made an effective malaria vaccine.</string>

						<string>Unless there is a last-minute stay, Troy Anthony Davis will die Wednesday by lethal injection, raising the distinct possibility that the state of Georgia will have executed an innocent man. His is perhaps the highest-profile death penalty case in the country, attracting the attention of such public figures as former President Jimmy Carter , Pope Benedict XVI and former FBI Director William Sessions, all of whom have called for clemency, as well as the European Union , which on Monday urged Georgia's pardons board to commute Davis' sentence. The board was not swayed. On Tuesday, after hearing hours of testimony from both sides, it rejected Davis' request for clemency and set the stage for his execution.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>We have no idea whether or not Davis is innocent; he is the only person who knows for sure whether he gunned down 27-year-old police officer and former Army Ranger Mark MacPhail in a Burger King parking lot in Savannah in 1989. But there have been so many doubts raised since his conviction that it's impossible to state with any certainty that he's guilty, either. This is why his sentence should have been commuted to life without parole, and it's why the death penalty should be abolished. Once the ultimate sanction has been enforced, it's impossible to take it back when further evidence of innocence emerges.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>If the U.S. justice system has failed Davis, it may be because it's so difficult to overturn capital convictions. A Georgia jury found him guilty, despite the lack of a murder weapon or any other physical evidence linking him to the shooting, based on witness testimony that later proved to be unreliable. Seven of the nine prosecution witnesses recanted their testimony after the trial, with some claiming it was coerced by police, and some witnesses have identified another man as MacPhail's killer. Yet appeals courts have opted not to reverse the jury's decision because even with all the troubling new details, defense attorneys haven't been able to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Davis is innocent. That's a different burden of proof than is required at trial, where prosecutors need to demonstrate guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This means that even when new testimony raises doubts about the original verdict, it's sometimes not enough to save a defendant's life.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>For a state to justify executing someone, the case against him or her must be ironclad. The case against Davis is anything but. Georgia's governor has no power to stop executions, and Davis' defense attorneys may be out of options. His execution, if it proceeds, should remind all Americans of the potential for injustice lying at the heart of a primitive method of punishment.</string>
