aboutText			= ExtempDB is a database that catalogs articles for use in \
						competitive extemporaneous speaking. It crawls through \
						major news sites and stores articles for use in offline \
						mode. This way, the articles are still available without \
						internet access and thus within the competition rules.

usageHeading		= Usage
usageText			= There currently two main means of navigating the database: \
						the browse view and the hierarchy view. The browse view \
						allows you to navigate directly to a list of articles on \
						a given topic; you must enter the topic name into the \
						text box in the view. The hierarchy view presents all \
						indexed topics in a hierarchical manner, providing a \
						link to the list of relevant articles for each topic. \
						The full text of each article is available from the \
						article list.
