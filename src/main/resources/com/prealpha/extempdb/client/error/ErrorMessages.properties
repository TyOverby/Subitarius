heading				= Oops!
exception			= An exception was caught by the exception handler. This means there was either a problem fetching data from the server, or there was an unhandled failure somewhere in the client code. In particular, the server may have gone offline since the client was loaded. If you are sure the server is still accessible, there is probably a bug, and you should send the following to the code monkeys, along with a description of what you were doing when this message appeared:
invalidSession		= The server reported that your session cookie is invalid. Please refresh the page to continue.
incompatibleService	= The application has been updated since you loaded this page. Please refresh the page to continue.
back				= Go back
