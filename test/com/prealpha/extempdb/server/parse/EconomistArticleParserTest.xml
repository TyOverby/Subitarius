				<string>Video nasty: The film business is slumping. It needs to start dealing directly with consumers</string>

						<string>IN “THE RING”, a Hollywood remake of a Japanese horror film, a videotape has a deadly effect on those who watch it. In reality the opposite is happening: viewers are killing Hollywood’s home-video business. People are rapidly discovering new ways of watching films at home that pose a grave threat to the most profitable part of the film business.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>In America, by far the biggest home-entertainment market, spending on videotapes and discs has dropped by 29% since 2004. Piracy is one reason. Another is the end of the format-replacement cycle: once you have a DVD of “Casablanca” you don’t need another one—and you probably won’t buy a high-definition Blu-ray disc, either. But the big reason is the rise of cheap, convenient rental outfits like Redbox, which runs kiosks, and Netflix, which streams some films and sends others through the post. The move from buying to renting is a calamity for Hollywood, a low-margin business that has come to rely on disc sales to push films into profitability.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Like music, newspapers and books before it, the film business has been disrupted by innovative, fast-moving distributors whose products have caught on with the public (see article). Tinseltown’s attempts so far to see off the threat have fallen flat, partly because the studios have failed to co-ordinate their efforts. But if Hollywood moves quickly and boldly it should be able to disrupt the disrupters.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Led by Sony, a consortium of studios, technology firms and retailers are working on a new way of distributing digital copies of films. The idea is that consumers will be able to buy the rights to films stored “in the cloud” and stream them to any device. That should make buying more appealing. But it also gives the studios an opportunity to go straight to consumers.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>At the moment Hollywood is a business-to-business industry: it rents films to cinema chains and ships discs to big-box retailers and rental firms. Digital distribution should allow it to become much more consumer-facing. The studios could greatly expand their efforts to sell films directly. They could offer to upgrade existing DVDs to digital files. At a minimum, they could develop customer databases that they could use to refine their marketing campaigns. The studios are old-school advertisers: every year they spend billions of dollars on scattershot campaigns that often hit the wrong people. Every dollar spent trying to persuade a grandmother to see a Quentin Tarantino film is a dollar wasted (Quentin’s granny excepted).</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Here’s looking at you</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Disney and Pixar are brands, but most studios are not. Nobody goes to see a film because it is made by Fox. Increasingly though the films they release are brands—consider “Harry Potter” or “Pirates of the Caribbean”. The studios also employ actors and directors who are brands in their own right. They should market directly to people who love those brands.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>It will not be easy to take such a radical step. But the trail has been blazed by another medium. Record labels have been hit much harder by piracy and have seen retail outlets disappear. They have been forced to deal directly with consumers. Lady Gaga’s website is run not by the pop star but by Universal Music, which uses it, and the consumer information it collects, to sell directly to her fans. That outfit has become far better at mining consumer data than the film studios. A common refrain in Hollywood is that the film business must not go the way of music. In this sense, at least, it should.</string>

				<string>The classic car-boot story</string>

						<string>THERE are plenty of departure-lounge stories in Africa that could get you deported. Then there are what Baobab calls car-boot stories, the publication of which might result in a shot in the back of the head at night in some isolated spot and an unexpected meal of filet de hack for a hyena. Baobab has skirted around several car-boot stories in recent years including extrajudicial killings by police, money received by generals for non-existent soldiers and weapons, and gold and platinum vanished from central banks. But the classic car-boot story is drug-smuggling. Drug cartels are colluding with the state in west and east Africa to transport drugs into Europe. More significantly, large amounts of drug money are being laundered in Africa through opaque investments in stockholdings and property.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Since this Baobab, in years hence, has ambitions to wade into a river in the Outer Hebrides and catch a sea trout and to sail the African bit of the Indian Ocean, then as things stand an investigative piece is not likely to happen. But a report issued this month by the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) touches on some of the broad themes.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Cocaine is being transported to Europe through west African countries in larger quantities than ever. According to intelligence sources at least 20% of the cocaine in Europe has come through west Africa. Much of it makes landfall in Guinea-Bissau, brought by fast boat and plane from the Caribbean. Other landings are made in Liberia, the Gambia, Guinea and Senegal. A lot of cocaine ends up in Nigeria. Some is bought by plush locals. Far more is trafficked to Europe aboard commercial flights. A Nigerian politician was arrested last year with two kilos of cocaine packed in condoms in his stomach as he prepared to fly out of the country. Another route is through the Sahara directly to Italy.</string>
					</void>
					<void method="add">
						<string>Unrest in Libya is likely being exploited by cartels to move in large shipments of drugs. A lot of this will be heroin coming from east Africa. The INCB estimates that 15 tonnes of heroin is smuggled into Europe each year from east Africa. Some of it is taken by air crews and passengers on commercial flights. The bulk is believed to be hidden in the holds of cargo planes flying roses from Addis Ababa, Nairobi and Arusha airports.</string>
